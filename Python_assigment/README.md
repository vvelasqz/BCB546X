# Python Assignment

### Due: 31 March 2017

## Summary

### Document written code and fill in the gaps

Your colleague, Dr. X, has given you a partially written Python script to work with your shared data files. 
You plan to translate cytochrome-b sequences to amino acids for each of 9 species of bears. 
You will then compute some simple summaries of the amino-acid composition of these sequences and add these values to a DataFrame, which already contains the average adult mass of each species. 
You will additionally create some plots of your data. 
In this script you will find one function and additional lines of code that are working, but not adequately documented. Since Dr. X's experience with Python is different than your own, you may find that some of the suggested functions and approaches are unfamiliar to you. However, you have agreed to thoroughly document your script in order to better understand your work.

Additionally, Dr. X has written some comments and pseudocode that outline other components of the script that you agreed to complete. Since you're a conscientious scientist, you will also carefully document your own code.

### To complete the assignment and analysis, create a single Jupyter notebook that documents the entire workflow. 

## Details

* Download the necessary files from the [`Python_Assignment/pyhw-files`](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546X-Spring2017/tree/master/Python_Assignment/pyhw-files) folder in the course repository and add them to your own repository where you will submit this assignment. The files required are:
    * `python_translate.py`
    * `bears_data.csv`
    * `bears_cytb.fasta`
* Be sure to install the BioPython library so that this script will work. (You may have already done this in an early [Python lesson](https://eeob-biodata.github.io/2017-python-programming/02-datatypes).)
* You will find explicit instructions and the code/comments from Dr. X in the file called `python_translate.py`.
Specific tasks are enumerated (1-8) in the script file with comments at the top.
* Create a new Jupyter notebook in your repository. 
    * In this notebook you will carefully annotate and execute the code already provided in `python_translate.py`. If you're unfamiliar with a bit of code, you can find lots of resources and information on the internet. Be sure to cite (by providing URLs) information appropriately. 
    * You must also write the missing code that is outlined by pseudocode and comments.
    * Remember to document everything clearly!
* Commit and push your completed Python analyses in the Jupyter notebook to your repository
* Create a link to your completed Jupyter notebook using [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
* Send the above link and the URL to your git repository to the instructors via Slack by the end of the day on March 31.
